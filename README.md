This repository contains small Streamlit apps for data analysis. The `filter_app.py` script demonstrates how to load an Excel file, filter it by multiple conditions and optionally request a short summary from an LLM using Langchain.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run filter_app.py
   ```
3. Upload an Excel file and interact with the filters on screen.
